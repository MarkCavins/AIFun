This is a mix of LLM app ideas written by Claud

The first app will be a workout tracker that includes a 5 day routine with exercise ideas that focus on
  3 days of upper body
  2 days of abs and lower body

The app allows you to track your progress by day and how many sets you can do. It is not interactive so if you decide to do 4 sets this cannot track it.
There is the ability to reset the tracker after completing a week.

Ideas for improvement
1. Add interactive number of sets
2. Allow users to build their own workouts based on a preset of exercises
     The next step will be to add in a google sheet with over 200 exercises
3. Allow for the number of exercises to increase based on time. It is hard coded for 30 minutes but nothing says you cannot do longer

Other ideas will come online as I continue to work with Claud
